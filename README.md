# eliza
eliza is a "chat bot" of sorts that can ask the user questions and then make a decision based on their response.


To run eliza you will need;
 - python 3.x installed
 - lib os
 - lib gTTS
 - audio decoder mpg321 on macOS 
 
 You should be able to run eliza on Windows, but you would need another audio decoder besides mpg321 I believe.
